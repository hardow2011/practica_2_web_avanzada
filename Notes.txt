Loans and Receipts are the same class.
What sets them apart is the hasBeenReturned class.
If true, false, the Receipt is a loan still. Otherwise it is 
really a Receipt. If the client decides to return some borrowed items 
of the same loan, but not all, a new clone Receipt will be created, with the 
hasBeenReturned property set to true.
